  Hi, my name's Marius and I am a fullstack developer. I am a goal orientated, steadfast and passionate developer who enjoys challenging myself at all angles. I thrive working in a team with common milestones, but I am not afraid to take the initiative and do what needs to be done. Throughout my career and hard-work, I have devoted time to learn new skills and abilities to aid me in both my personal and work projects. I have experience within payment solutions and web technologies, problem solving day to day challenges and being a valuable member of the team.

          Innovating the point of sale experience
        description: | # this will include new lines to allow paragraphs
          To date, I have been working with Point of Sale Products across Open's Portfolio. Within Management and Q&A, I created, prioritized, and reproduced issues with an external team. We communicated daily to oversee our work.

          Integrations focused on integrating Wolt with Open One System by creating a worker service that communicates with both Wold and Open API. Upgrading and maintaining the integration with Vipps was another part of integrations.

          I also worked with consultants to develop custom reports for our customers, as well as third-line support, which involved searching and debugging issues.

          The program includes theory and methods for programming both individual machines and machines in networks. One learns to create systems that are reliable, flexible, user-friendly and efficient. Practical solutions to problems are part of the education. One gains insight into the technology behind the computers, how the machine can be used to solve tasks and what challenges the information technology society gives us.

          IT is more than a tool for other subjects. As an computer scientist, we are an active driving force in social development. One works with basic issues that provide new insights and opportunities throughout society, by helping creating new applications.
